This set of tutorials is going to follow the [[http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/][Python TCOD tutorial]], but will be
written in Common Lisp and use the BearLibTerminal library.
*** Prior Knowledge
This tutorial assumes you are familiar with programming in Common Lisp. If
you're not familiar, I would highly recommend checking out [[http://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/][A Road to Common Lisp]]
on Steve Losh's blog. It provides many valuable resources to get up to speed
with Common Lisp, and is how I got started.
*** Installation
I will be using the SBCL implementation, and Emacs as my editor. Specifically, I
use the [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] configuration.
